# Amazon FBA Repricing System Blog

Welcome to my development blog for an intelligent Amazon FBA repricing system. This project combines machine learning, competitive analysis, and strategic pricing algorithms to optimize product pricing on Amazon's marketplace.

## About Me

I'm an Amazon FBA media seller with nearly 4 years of experience, consistently generating over $100k in annual sales with healthy profit margins. After managing 1,500+ SKUs and experiencing the challenges of manual pricing firsthand, I'm building a production-grade repricing system that solves the problems traditional repricers miss.

## About This Project

This system represents a data-driven approach to automated repricing that goes beyond simple rule-based logic. It leverages:

- **LLM-Powered Decision Making**: Large language models analyze market conditions and make nuanced pricing decisions
- **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Combines real-time competitive data, historical sales patterns, training examples, and Amazon marketplace knowledge
- **Strategic Pricing Logic**: Implements time-based strategies, fulfillment-aware pricing, and market leadership tactics
- **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: Robust caching, file monitoring, atomic operations, and comprehensive error handling

## Status

This project is currently in active development and **not open source**. The code represents proprietary algorithms and business logic for a planned SaaS offering.
