# Amazon FBA Repricing System Blog

Welcome to my development blog for an intelligent Amazon FBA repricing system. This project combines machine learning, competitive analysis, and strategic pricing algorithms to optimize product pricing on Amazon's marketplace.

## About This Project

This system represents a sophisticated approach to automated repricing that goes beyond simple rule-based logic. It leverages:

- **LLM-Powered Decision Making**: Advanced language models analyze market conditions and make nuanced pricing decisions
- **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Combines real-time competitive data, historical sales patterns, training examples, and Amazon marketplace knowledge
- **Strategic Pricing Logic**: Implements time-based strategies, fulfillment-aware pricing, and market leadership tactics
- **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: Robust caching, file monitoring, atomic operations, and comprehensive error handling

## Updates

- **[November 23, 2025 - Introduction: Building an Intelligent Amazon Repricing System](2025-11-23-introduction.md)**

## Status

This project is currently in active development and **not open source**. The code represents proprietary algorithms and business logic for a planned SaaS offering.
